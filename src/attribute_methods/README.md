#Attribute methods
Attribute method are simple to implement and work fast. In this project they are used to filter programs that are not
similar for sure. They are based on counting some operators, structures or other program attributes amount which
does not consider program structure. That is why these methods are not reliable and not used for
getting final results.</br>
To increase reliability of attribute method, multiple checks based on different parameters should be used.</br>
