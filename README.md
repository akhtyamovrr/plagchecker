This is a python project which is aimed to check programs for the level of identity.
Now it is being developed for C language, it should work with single-file and multifile projects.
The main idea is to make configurable to be able to change/add metrics and different languages support in the future without changes in existing code. That is why this application is based on plug-ins for reading, estimation.
